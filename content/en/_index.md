# Simple Rules For Losing Weight

Let's not drag this out any longer. These are the rules:

1. Try it for two weeks
2. Document it
3. Analyse-it
4. Adapt or discard
5. Be patient, wait 2 weeks
6. Start again!

I believe in controlled experimentation because life itself is an experiment.

**Why Do I Do It?**

In the spring of 2023, this question was asked at our 30th reunion, and I started thinking about it then. The most straightforward answer is that I do it **because I can**. And the more I do it, the more I can do it. It was a liberating feeling the first time I could put my knee on my chest or do my first single-leg squat. Obese Barna was not and would never have been able to do that. And if I could do it, you can do it.

I experiment with everything and write about it a lot, but if you're bored of the blah blah blah and just want to know how to start losing weight, you can skip straight to the [Let's begin](#lets-begin) section.

And what should the above rules apply to?

+ Meals
    * Gluten and lactose-free experiments
    * Protein and carbohydrate-based diet tests
    * Intermittent fasting experiments
+ Exercise
    * Experiments with exercise at a particular heart rate
    * Treadmill walking and indoor bike testing
    * Trying out gymnastics or yoga
+ Mental health
    * Stress reduction methods
    * Trying relaxation
    * Experimenting with sleep

## My Weight Loss Story

My highest weight ever was 127 kg, sometime in the mid-2000s. The picture on the left was taken in 2009; I'm the guy in the blue t-shirt. The photo on the right is of me in the summer of 2023.

Of course, I tried a lot of things, but my weight yo-yoed up and down until in 2018, I got to the point where it became relevant to take a blood pressure medication regularly. This was not something I wanted at all, at 43 years old, to embark on a lifelong medication journey. On January 1, 2019, I made a New Year's resolution to change my lifestyle, weighing 118 kg.

The first year was about finding my way. I embarked on learning a relaxation technique, autogenic training, to combat stress - my first success. Unfortunately, I didn't lose more than 6 kg that year. I really wanted to, but it didn't work.

The subsequent success came when I tried IF (intermittent fasting); I got breakfast out of my life and felt better, and finally managed to lose weight.

Then COVID hit, and I was absolutely terrified. I saw everywhere that fat people were at much greater risk than their normal-weight counterparts. And then I finally got on the treadmill that had been gathering dust for so long and started walking. I didn't want to go outside, so I walked inside. At first, I walked a little, then I increased my daily walking to over 40 minutes. Then I started to monitor my heart rate, and by adjusting the incline and speed on the treadmill, I got my heart rate to stay between 114 and 131.

This was my traditional fat-burning range at the time. I didn't know the science behind it at the time, let alone that this heart rate range was the subject of much debate, with many calculation methods to choose from on the internet. The calculation I used at the time was age-dependent. It starts from the definition of the maximum heart rate, which is 220 - age. 65-75% of this number is the fat-burning range. At 45 years old, that meant for me a heart rate of exactly 113.75 to 131.25. And it worked.

Then, of course, everything stopped a bit after a while, so that's when I started experimenting. Bread was out of my life a long time ago, but when I found out that my wife Eszter was gluten intolerant, that gave me another boost, and I got rid of pasta. I started measuring my calorie intake and using various calculators to determine my calorie intake and how much I could lose weight. I did a lot of experimenting and ended up with around 1400 calories. And by then I had already skipped dinner. I ate these 1400 calories all at once, at lunchtime. My primary food source is, unfortunately, animal protein...

And let's stop here because there came a moment in my weight loss when I looked at myself in the mirror and didn't recognise myself. I stood and looked at my new face, my new body, and although it felt good to lose weight, I couldn't help but feel wrong about my new look. There's no shame in asking for help; I went to a psychologist to help me process the changes.

I also started paying attention to my sleep; I deliberately set aside 8 hours for rest and switched from 6 hours to 8 hours of bedtime. Sure, it's easy to say, and even now, it's not 100%, but even if I wake up at night, I don't open my eyes and start looking at the clock. My watch will buzz on my wrist when I can get up anyway. Until then, I have to lie with my eyes closed. I've also started using earplugs; my smartwatch says it adds 8-10 points to my sleep at night.

For me, exercise is not just walking or running or cycling. I'm actively doing spinal exercises, or instead, yoga, because the traditional spinal exercises have been replaced by yoga exercises, which I do every day after my daily workout.

I probably have a carbohydrate intolerance, but I don't have the energy to check it out. I am constantly trying to reintroduce carbohydrates into my diet. My most recent attempt was in October 2023, the month I was preparing to run a half marathon and ran over 200 km. Carbohydrates are supposed to be essential for long-distance runners, so I switched half of my protein to carbohydrates while running - the result was an extra 5kg in 2 weeks. As I documented everything daily, it was easy enough to see, so I stopped carbs in the middle of the month to get my weight back by the end of October. Once again, all this while running 200 km that month.

Then, in November 2023, I tried a completely dairy-free diet - milk, cheese, butter, yoghurt, and protein powders - all of which I put on the no-food list and a recurring muscle ache disappeared. And since I haven't eaten dairy since, the muscle pain hasn't returned. Who would have thought it would make such a difference?

## Maintaining My Weight

Unfortunately, I can't do it without counting calories every day. I can maintain my weight by avoiding high carbohydrate intake and the calorie count I've experimented with. If I "go off track" because of a holiday, I don't worry anymore because I know that as soon as I get back into the swing of things, I'll pick up the pace again and adjust my weight again.

Is this sustainable? I wonder if everyone wants to take the time. I exercise daily; I'm currently testing the [MAF 180](https://philmaffetone.com/method/) heart rate range and counting calories every day. I plan to try again in early 2024 to get more carbohydrates back into my diet and give legumes a try (although they are also high in protein, at least not animal protein).

## Let's Begin! {#lets-begin}

Buy a heart rate monitor, a gym membership or a treadmill or an indoor bike and start moving slowly in your fat-burning range. Focus on getting your body to handle the load first, and get yourself to a point where you can move slowly for an hour: walking or cycling. If you have muscle soreness, you've overdone it. Take it easy. Be patient with yourself; just as the pounds didn't come on overnight, they won't come off overnight. Get back exercises into your schedule. You won't believe how important it is. You can see what I do here: this is my [Garmin public profile](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/UnbrownGorger).

Get a body weight and a kitchen scale. Measure your weight every day and record the calories you eat. Don't cheat with it; you're only cheating yourself. Experiment with cutting out carbohydrates, but be aware that you will only lose water at first. As soon as you get back on carbs, your body will regain some of the lost weight because it will retain water again. You can see what I eat here, it's [MyFitnessPal public profile](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/EnvaultRoll).

Watch your sleep. Create the opportunity for 8 hours of sleep. If you have to get up at 6am, get to bed by 10pm at the latest, and whatever the temptation, wait to open your eyes until your alarm goes off. Don't look at the clock; just lie with your eyes closed. It worked for me.
