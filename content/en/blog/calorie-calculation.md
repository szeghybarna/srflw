Calorie counting is a tricky area. Many believe in it, many oppose it and many consider it unsustainable. I don't.

There is nothing else that will suit the vast majority of people. I've tried eating "on intuition", eating only as much as my body requires. Well, I'm a hungry wolf when I'm not in control. If I don't set limits, I can't control my appetite. Plus, if I knew how much food my body needed, I wouldn't have lived the previous part of my life overweight. Padaboom.

One more controversial thing I'd like to bring up is [BMI](https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/fact-sheets/item/a-healthy-lifestyle---who-recommendations "BMI"). Here again, I can say that there is no other that is so universally applicable, even if not perfect. Just as a reminder, when I started my lifestyle change on 1 January 2019, I already had a BMI of over 40, i.e. I was very, very, very obese.

> | BMI        | Nutritional status |
> | ---------- | ------------------ |
> | Below 18.5 | Underweight        |
> | 18.5–24.9  | Normal weight      |
> | 25.0–29.9  | Pre-obesity        |
> | 30.0–34.9  | Obesity class I    |
> | 35.0–39.9  | Obesity class II   |
> | Above 40   | Obesity class III  |

Most calorie calculators start with your current weight, how many calories you need to reach that weight, and try to determine calorie data from that. That is, when you lose weight, you have to recalculate your weight. When you gain weight, you have to recalculate again. But why?!

Instead, I started from the fact that I have a target BMI that I want to achieve. I calculated how many kilograms that is and counted calories for that weight. I was trying to kill two birds with one stone: get used to eating at a healthy level for me and lose weight at the same time.

My calculator starts from the [Revised Harris-Benedict equation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9967803/ "Revised Harris-Benedict equation"), which calculates RMR:

>
>RMR females:
>   
>   (7.38 * weight in kg) + (607 * height in m) - (2.31 * age in years) + 43
> 
>RMR males:
>
>   (9.65 * weight in kg) + (573 * height in m) - (5.08 * age in years) + 260;
>   
 

RMR, Resting Metabolic Rate, is the amount of kcal the body consumes at rest. This includes basic daily physical activity such as toileting or light movements. Think of it as sedentary work at home during Covid.

There is a lot of data you can enter into this calculator, the only thing you don't have to enter is your weight, that's just included to see what your current BMI is. The data in the calculator is populated with my 2019 data.

For optimal BMI, enter the BMI you want to achieve. For example, 23 is already very good, I just decided to bring my BMI down to 20-21 in the last couple of months because it's more ideal for long distance running.

I put the calorie deficit percentage deduction in the calculator to help you even if you're already at the weight you wanted to be. Looking at the [blue zones](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/blue-zones#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4 "blue zones") - notable for having a much higher average life expectancy than other areas - people living there are in a constant calorie deficit. Blue zone residents eat about 20-30% less per day than the generally recommended daily calorie intake. There are many other factors that make people in blue zones live longer, but only one of them counts in the calorie count.

Weekly active calories are the amount of calories your smartwatch/phone detects in a week. It's not precise, but it's a good starting point. As you start to move, this is a value to keep an eye on and adjust your daily calories accordingly.

You can also enter your weekly weight loss target, I wouldn't recommend more than half a kilo. Losing weight slowly is more sustainable, and you may not even need to set a weight loss goal at first if simply moving more gets you going.

If you want to gain weight, enter "calorie deficit" percentage or "weekly weight loss" in kilograms with a minus sign.

If you have filled in the values, the calculator will update the result on its own, but if not, there is a "Calculate!" button to set your calorie goal. In the cell with the purple background you will find your actual BMI and your target weight, these are indicative values.

The result is calculated separately for men and women based on the equation. I include the decrease/increase items and the result is in the dark pink and dark blue cells.

This calorie amount is not set in stone. It depends on a lot of factors on how much food and how your gut processes it, so take these numbers as a basis for experimentation. Good luck!
