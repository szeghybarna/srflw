I spent about three months following the MAF 180 training plan, which was a success! Unfortunately, I have only done a few evaluations, but my average heart rate has dropped nicely as a result of regular low-heart rate exercise.

Now I'm leveling up and switching to Zone 2 workouts. I try to put together my weekly exercise regime as follows:

- 5 minutes of gymnastics or warm-up every morning (this morning gymnastics is a miracle; I've been doing it since January)
- 3 yoga or mobility classes a week
- 4 hours of Zone 2 exercise (spread out over the week) in the form of indoor cycling, treadmill or trail running
- 1 or 2 HIIT workouts per week, occasionally 20-30 minutes, where I try to push myself to max heart rate
- at least 10 minutes of stretching after each workout

For Zone 2 workouts, I calculate the heart rate range based on the LTHR (lactate threshold or lactic acid threshold) determined by the Garmin gadgets, which is the physical stress level at which the body's production of lactate, or lactic acid, increases suddenly. For me, Zone 2 right now means a range between 130-145. I can change this as my fitness level changes.

In addition to the maximum heart rate (MHR) determined during a vigorous workout, I also need the Garmin chest transducer to calculate LTHR.

I have these, so the LTHR-based Zone 2 calculation results in a heart rate range of 130-145, which is 80-89% of LTHR.

I wonder how I can improve with this heart rate range. I don't have a specific goal right now. I've taken a liking to regular exercise and am experimenting with it to see if it benefits me.

I haven't changed my diet, yet my weight has fluctuated lately. It is going down, just slower than I had hoped. No problem, I'm in no hurry. All that excess weight didn't come on in 1-2 days either; I've got time, the important thing is that it's going down. I'm still aiming for around 60kg and only need to lose 5kg to get there. Almost there now.
