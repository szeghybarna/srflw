If you're overweight and looking to change your lifestyle, you may be wondering which type of exercise is most effective for you. Some people favor fast, intense workouts, while others prefer **low-intensity, longer-duration sessions**. But why is it beneficial to use your body's fat to fuel cardio exercise, especially if you're overweight? In this article, I will provide answers to that question!

During cardio exercise, your body primarily uses two energy sources: carbohydrates and fats. The main difference lies in your preferences for selecting them.

You rely on **carbohydrates** during **high-intensity** exercise, like fast running or HIIT. While they provide a quick energy source, this is only effective in the short term. Carbohydrates quickly deplete glycogen stores, leading to faster fatigue.

During longer, **moderate-intensity** exercises like walking, the body uses **fat** as its primary source of energy. This provides a slower yet sustained energy supply, making it more beneficial for endurance training and weight loss, as it does not quickly deplete energy stores.

If you have lost a significant amount of weight, your body is likely better at using energy from fat. This is why individuals who have lost more weight tend to perform better during longer, low-intensity workouts.

The fat-burning zone, located between Zones 2 and 3, is the heart rate range where the body utilizes the highest percentage of fat for energy.

This heart rate range is **easily achievable and sustainable**. It does not stress your joints or your whole body, making it ideal for longer, low-intensity workouts like walking.

Did you know that **walking is one of the best ways to burn fat?** It is low-intensity yet effective for fat burning. Walking requires no special equipment and can be done anywhere at any time.

Burning energy from fat offers numerous benefits, not just for effective weight loss, but also for maintaining a sustainable lifestyle in the long term. Walking at a fat-burning heart rate can be especially beneficial for overweight individuals, as it is easy to do, puts less strain on the joints, and efficiently burns fat.

To effectively burn fat, you need to spend **at least 30 to 40 minutes in the zone**.

You can enhance fat burning by modifying your diet. To help your body efficiently utilize fat for energy during cardio workouts or walking, it's important to adopt a diet that promotes this process. Following a **low-carbohydrate diet that is high in healthy fats**, such as the Mediterranean or ketogenic diet, can significantly aid in fat burning.

Choose foods like avocados, seeds, fish, chicken, eggs, dairy, and olive oil. Avoid refined carbohydrates and sugary foods, as they can quickly raise blood sugar levels and lead your body back to relying on carbohydrate-based energy.

If you seek a straightforward method to calculate your daily protein and fat intake, adhere to this guideline:

- Consume protein in grams equal to twice and half your target body weight daily.
- Your fat intake should match your target body weight in grams.

Although it may seem overwhelming, it is crucial to **transition your body to burning fat**, as this is essential for weight loss.

For instance, if your target weight is 60 kg, you should consume at least 150 grams of protein and 60 grams of fat each day. This amounts to a total of 1,140 calories. The remaining calories should come from carbohydrates.

Supporting **muscle maintenance** is essential, and adequate protein intake plays a key role in this process. Before a fat-burning workout, it's advisable to consume a light, protein-rich meal that is easy to digest, such as natural yogurt or a small handful of nuts. After your workout, aim to combine protein with healthy fats to enhance recovery and promote fat loss.
