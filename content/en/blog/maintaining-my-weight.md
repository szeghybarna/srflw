Unfortunately, I can't do it without counting calories every day. I can maintain my weight by avoiding high carbohydrate intake and the calorie count I've experimented with. If I "go off track" because of a holiday, I don't worry anymore because I know that as soon as I get back into the swing of things, I'll pick up the pace again and adjust my weight again.

Is this sustainable? I wonder if everyone wants to take the time. I exercise daily; I'm currently testing the [MAF 180](https://philmaffetone.com/method/ "MAF 180") heart rate range and counting calories every day. I plan to try again in early 2024 to get more carbohydrates back into my diet and give legumes a try (although they are also high in protein, at least not animal protein).
