Many believe chocolate and dieting are incompatible, but this is not necessarily the case. Weight loss is achieved by creating a calorie deficit, which means that you eat fewer calories than you burn over an extended period of time. This is not a short-term solution, but a long-term commitment that needs to be maintained for weeks, months, or even years to achieve sustainable results.

I ate at least one bar of dark chocolate, weighing between 75g and 150g, every day for eight days while maintaining a calorie deficit. However, I didn't continue this habit for two weeks since it's impossible for me to eat chocolate every day for the rest of my life. Nevertheless, I wanted to prove that it's possible to lose weight by consuming chocolate if you restrict your calorie intake.

*What to look for when choosing chocolate?*

"I always ensure that the chocolate I consume is free from dairy. This means that I cannot have any lactose or milk protein. As a result, I only opt for dark chocolate with high cocoa content, and milk chocolate is completely off the table. However, if you do not have a problem with dairy, milk chocolate is an option for you. Additionally, it is important to consider the range of flavors available and not stick to just one type of chocolate. Some chocolates may contain sweeteners that can cause a laxative effect, so it's best to be aware of this when making your selection."

*What can be disappointing?*

"BORING" seems to be the word that comes to mind. If you switch from eating 535g of chicken to 100g of 85% dark chocolate, you may initially lose weight because you'll be consuming a more calorie-dense diet. However, this weight loss is not necessarily fat loss but rather just a reduction in the amount of food content in your gut. Additionally, consuming too much chocolate may make you feel uncomfortable. If you plan to make this dietary change, you may want to consider taking a probiotic to help your body adjust, but it's not mandatory.

One issue is that consuming too few calories can cause feelings of hunger, leading to overeating. This creates a vicious cycle that is easy to fall into.

*How much weight have I lost?*

I began the experiment on January 19th and concluded it on January 26th. Here is how my weight and chocolate intake changed:

I noticed that my weight has decreased by 2.5 kg. However, I am still not certain about drawing any conclusions so soon. My weight has been fluctuating significantly this month due to my food experiments and occasional deviations from my plans. Also, when compared to my weight before Christmas, there is only a net loss of 1 kg within a month. Therefore, this 2.5 kg loss may just be part of the natural regression. I consider it a good experiment, and I will update the article if my weight starts to go up.

*How do you try it?*

To start off, let me clarify that I don't want to encourage you. In fact, I would like to discourage you. The key to weight loss is a calorie deficit, irrespective of what you eat. Simply consume fewer calories than your body requires. You can use this [calorie calculator]({{< ref "2023-12-29-calorie-calculation" >}} "calorie calculator") to determine how many calories you need and create a deficit that you can maintain. If you have a craving for chocolate, you can factor it into your daily calorie limit and still lose weight while indulging in chocolate.

*But if you do want to try it:*

* Plan ahead for your [calorie deficit]({{< ref "2023-12-29-calorie-calculation" >}} "calorie deficit").
* Buy a variety of chocolates.
* Prepare your body with probiotics.
* Weigh and record everything.
* Analyze your experiences.
