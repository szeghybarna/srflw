February is almost over, and you still haven't started anything? I know the feeling. I put off any lifestyle changes for years. I mean, there were things I tried but didn't have the patience to wait for the results, and there were things that worked, but then I didn't incorporate them into my life.

What makes it different now?

Start with tiny changes. For example, use these steps and find a reason for yourself why you are doing it. Build them into your daily routine, find space and time in your day for them:

1. "I have 5 minutes every day to enter my calories into an app. I want to find out the reason for my continued weight gain." 

2. "I have 8 minutes in the morning to do a short workout. It's nice to start the day with my body already prepared for the day. At least I can exercise my limbs that have been lying down at night."

3. "I have time for a 10-minute back workout when I get home from work. It's really good for my spine. If I do it regularly, my back pain will disappear, and I can move freely again."

4. "I have time to check my calorie balance every week. I know what calorie deficit I need to reach to lose weight. This helps keep me focused on my lifestyle change."

5. "I can fit in half-hour cardio sessions several times a week. I'm finally doing something for my weight loss and my health. It's worth the investment; I'll live longer with fewer problems."

If you have the skills, knowledge and motivation, all you need is a kick-start to take the second step after the first.

I know these are clich√©s, but we have to trust ourselves to do it. Find people you can talk to about it, people you can ask what you can do to make a change. That's why I created the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1098348161611343 "Facebook group"). You can ask anonymously if you find the question embarrassing.

I have time to check my calorie balance every week.
