Unfortunately or not, as science progresses, more and more nutrients are being discovered to play an important role in our lives. As I've gotten older, I've become more and more dedicated to looking for supplements that can help optimize my health and live longer.

Let's look at the supplements I take on a daily basis:

**Vitamin B complex**

> My goal is to support my nervous system, I started taking it specifically to manage stress. The positive effects on the skin are also good, too much weight loss for me has also resulted in slightly stretched skin, so I'm happy to spend on anything that helps skin regeneration.

**BCAA + glutamine**

> I take it in powder form (about a third of the daily recommended dose) for sport, it helps with muscle building and recovery.

**Vitamin C**

> I take it primarily to boost my immune system, but it's also a not insignificant factor that I may eat only animal food for days on days, so I don't have a chance to get it from vegetables or fruit.

**Coenzyme Q10**

> A champion of antioxidant protection, it is also an anti-inflammatory and anti-ageing agent.

**Vitamin D**

> In winter, I get little sunshine anyway, plus I live a sedentary, indoor lifestyle in front of a computer. I need a vitamin D supplement because I don't get enough sunlight unfortunately. It's also important for building muscles.

**Glycine**

> Glycine is both a sedative and sleep aid, which can also help combat stress. On the other hand, it is a very good supplement for collagen in skin repair. I consume it dissolved in water.

**Fish oil**

> Fish oil can be good for everything, but I take it mostly for its positive effects on the cardiovascular system, but it is also anti-inflammatory.

**Collagen**

> I take collagen to protect my skin and joints. Right now it's in capsule form, but for a long time I drank it mixed with water, also in powder form.

**Creatine**

> Unfortunately, creatine is produced in decreasing amounts as we age, so I think it's very important to replenish it. It helps muscle building and recovery, improves performance. I take it in powder form.

**Magnesium Bisglycinate**

> This form of magnesium is absorbed more quickly and helps to regenerate muscles and prevent muscle soreness and cramps. It has a calming effect and I take it in the morning and before bedtime.

**Melatonin**

> I also take melatonin before bedtime, because it's supposed to help me sleep more restfully. As you get older, melatonin production decreases, so it's worth supplementing.

**Taurine**

> Helps the nervous system, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It improves performance and reduces oxidative stress, which slows down ageing. I take it in powder form.

I usually research the dosage and possible side effects carefully. I try to take the supplements that are most necessary and appropriate for me, I think twice about making changes. I would encourage everyone to read up or ask their doctor and pharmacist before starting to take any pills or powders regularly.
