Buy a heart rate monitor, a gym membership or a treadmill or an indoor bike and start moving slowly in your fat-burning range. Focus on getting your body to handle the load first, and get yourself to a point where you can move slowly for an hour: walking or cycling. If you have muscle soreness, you've overdone it. Take it easy. Be patient with yourself; just as the pounds didn't come on overnight, they won't come off overnight. Get back exercises into your schedule. You won't believe how important it is. You can see what I do here: this is my [Garmin public profile](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/UnbrownGorger).

Get a body weight and a kitchen scale. Measure your weight every day and record the calories you eat. Don't cheat with it; you're only cheating yourself. Try skipping breakfast or dinner. Experiment with cutting out carbohydrates, but be aware that you will only lose water at first. As soon as you get back on carbs, your body will regain some of the lost weight because it will retain water again.

Watch your sleep. Create the opportunity for 8 hours of sleep. If you have to get up at 6am, get to bed by 10pm at the latest, and whatever the temptation, wait to open your eyes until your alarm goes off. Don't look at the clock; just lie with your eyes closed. Bore your brain to sleep. It worked for me.
